# ESE350-SolarFarm
This repository hosts the source code for final project in Microcontrollers & Embedded Systems (ESE350) taught by University of Pennsylvania.

The purpose of this project was to create an efficient way to generate electric energy using solarpower by adding mobility to solar panels combined with an IOT feature that gives the usercontrol over the system.

The electronics consists of a mbed LPC1768 as main controller, web server for providing user interface, a Beaglebone Black as relay between controller and web server and Arduino Uno to control the artificial sun.

An example of web interface for remote monitoring and control is at :
